* **Codes**: codes for different types of analysis.
* **Efficiency**: to calculate/plot detection efficiencies for SuperWIMP interactions within Ge detectors; Rizalina and Katharina efficiencies are available.
* **FWHM**: to calculate FWHM for each dataset at different energies.
* **Livetimes**: 
* **MC**: to perform a MC study after the BAT analysis (sampling from BKG fit parameters -> fit using the signal+BKG models).
* **PSD**: to analyze data/results of spectra made up with only PSD data.
* **SuperWIMPs_couplings**: to extract limits on SuperWIMP couplings (startinf grom U90 limits on R_s).
* **run_config**: to study when detectors are ON/OFF/AC.
* **sigma**: to study the significance for R_s.
