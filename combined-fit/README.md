# Combined fit
Alternative version of the first SW analysis. Now, a partition cut is applied to different detectors and phases 
of the experiment, with the Lagrangian function that takes into account all of them.

Efficiencies, energetic resolutions and exposure levels are carefully handled for each single partition. 
The parameter of interest is the SW coupling, for which we directly extract an upper 90 C.I. limit.
